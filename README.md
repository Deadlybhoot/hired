# Hired a Full Stack Job Portal with React JS, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Clerk, Shadcn UI Tutorial ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- Hired is a dynamic job portal platform designed to connect job seekers with their dream jobs and enable recruiters to post job openings within their companies. The platform offers a user-friendly interface, providing two distinct options for job seekers and recruiters upon visiting the site.

- Using Supabase, I've ensured the integrity of the data, allowing only recruiters to post, delete, or update job listings, while job seekers can apply to jobs, not recruiters.

## For Recruiters

- To begin, recruiters must sign up on the platform. Once authenticated, they are redirected to the job posting page.

- Here on this page recruiter can create new job. A dedicated text editor is available for recruiters to outline job requirements.The "My Jobs" section allows recruiters to track the status of all jobs.

- Recruiter can update the job status as open or closed. Recruiters can also review applications, notify applicants about interviews, hiring decisions, or rejections.

## For Job Seekers

- Upon authentication, job seekers can view the latest job postings, search for specific roles by location or company, and save jobs for later consideration. Applying to jobs is straightforward, and users can upload their resumes for recruiters to review.
